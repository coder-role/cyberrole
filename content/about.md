Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Robert. Welcome to my blog. The purpose of this blog is to provide a space for me to document my journey through online platforms for learning ethical hacking and cybersecurity like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. My main focus is to refine my skills and build confidence, but if others benefit from reading my thought process, that would be a great bonus.
